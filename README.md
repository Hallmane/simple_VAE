# building a VAE from scratch
using mnist 28x28 images to begin with 

## Future ideas
* is LSTFT fast enough to do some sort of live decoding from mel spectrogram to audio?
* VAE+GANs?

## TODO
* Build a sound generating VAE with this video `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWSoEqWNh8w`
* RAVE paper `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.05011.pdf`
